# JIRA Board Scroller

## Intro
Scroll the JIRA board page top to bottom then bottom to top, make the texts more readable and remove everything around

It works with the new JIRA UI

## How it works
Just append `scroll=true` to the url of your board

In the options you can choose the speed of the scroll and weather or not activate the TV Mode which makes things a big bigger

### Enjoy
